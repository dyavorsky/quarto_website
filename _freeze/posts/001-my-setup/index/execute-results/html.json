For the rare times that I do, I use the **[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)** terminal application with the default **zsh** shell on Mac.  \n\nMy very minor set of configurations includes:\n\n - ghostty config: I use the Catppuccin Mocha theme\n - prompt config: I use [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U8LCjuQzdc) tutorial\n - zsh config: I add the zsh-autosuggestions with a double-tab keybinding to accept autosuggestions, the zsh-syntax-highlighting, and vim keybindings with custom functions to change the cursor shape between normal and insert modes. It's unremarkable, but the config file can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/dyavorsky/configs)\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Screenshot\n\n![](ghostty_on_mac.png)\n\n:::\n\n### On Windows\n\nI use Ubuntu via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It's currently configured to use Zsh as the shell, with the **Oh My Zsh** configuration framework and **PowerLevel10k** prompt theme.  I will likely change this setup in the near future.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Screenshot\n\n![](terminal_on_windows.png)\n\n:::\n\n-----\n\n# RStudio & Positron\n\nI use RStudio and Positron equally.\n\n#### RStudio Visual Look\n\nFor the visual look of RStudio, I use the RStudio theme *Darkstudio* and my own version of Atom's *One Dark* editor theme, along with the [Fira Code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fira-code.mirror/) font. They can be installed as follows:\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## RStudio Theme Installation\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# rstudio theme\ndevtools::install_github(\"https://github.com/rileytwo/darkstudio\")\n\npath_to_index <- \"/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/www/index.htm\"\ndarkstudio::activate(path_to_index) # on mac\ndarkstudio::activate() # on windows (open rstudio with \"run as admin\")\n\n# editor theme\nurl <- \"https://github.com/dyavorsky/atom-inspired-rstudio-theme/blob/main/atom_inspired.rstheme\"\nrstudioapi::addTheme(url, apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Screenshot\n\n![](atom-inspired.png)\n\n:::\n\n#### RStudio Shortcuts\n\nI run [this](https://github.com/dyavorsky/configs) complete set of customized shortcuts in order to:\n\n - avoid conflicts with system shortcuts and window management shortcuts\n - use a consistent set of key bindings for both Windows and Mac\n - remap bindings for operations I rarely use, to core part of my workflow\n \n\n#### Positron Visual Look\n\nI use the 'One Dark Pro Darker' theme, with minimal other customization.  I love how perfectly Positron 'just works' out of the box.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Screenshot\n\n![](positron_on_mac.png)\n\n:::\n\n\n-----\n\n# Mac Shortcuts\n\nI aggressively edit keyboard shortcuts on my mac. I find most of the defaults unnecessary, which I disable. I heavily utilize spaces, speech-to-text, and screenshots, adding shortcuts for each. Some apps require their own special additions -- for example, I can't believe Command-Enter doesn't send a message in Mail. I also find the Vimium Chrome extension (which enables keyboard-only navigation within the browser) to be essential.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Other Software\n\n - [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) to track things that need to get done. There's a version for every device and, as a backup, you can always access it from a browser\n - [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) is my password manager.  If you don't have one yet, you won't believe how much simpler and more secure authentication can be\n - [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for tracking academic literature. While not perfect, it's substantially better than a system based on a tree of sub-directories and verbose file names\n - [Typora](https://typora.io/) for writing markdown in a minimal editor (be sure to grab the [onedark](https://theme.typora.io/theme/OneDark/) theme)\n - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for maintaining a database of inter-linked markdown-based notes\n\n<!--\n\n## On My Mac\n\n - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for quick commands and as a sometimes replacement for Mac's spotlight search. \n - [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) as an enhanced screenshot and screen recorder.\n - [HandMirror](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hand-mirror/id1502839586?mt=12) for one-click checks before jumping on video meetings.\n - [Ice](https://icemenubar.app/) to simplify the top-right menu bar.\n - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for tiling windows, which may become obsolete with MacOS 15 Sequoia.\n\n-->\n\n\n\n",
