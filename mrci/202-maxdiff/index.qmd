The term "MaxDiff" is short-hand for Maximum Difference Scaling, which is a particular implementation of Best-Worst scaling (BWS). The technique's inventor, Jordan Louviere, recommends use of the term BWS, but I will follow the colloquial use of the term "MaxDiff" here. 

MaxDiff is a technique to acquire and assess stated preferences. This article will review the technique organized as five-step procedure. The researcher:

1. prepares the set of items to be evaluated,
2. constructs a design for how respondents will evaluate the items,
3. asks respondents evaluate items by completing multiple choice tasks,
4. analyzes the stated preference data, and 
5. summarizes and presents insights from the analysis.
