Key drivers analysis is an umbrella term used to describe methods that calculate relative importance scores for a group of predictors that are associated with an outcome variable.

Let's use the Boston dataset from the MASS package which provides the following information:

 - `medv`: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
 - `crim`: per capita crime rate by town.
 - `zn`: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
 - `indus`: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
 - `chas`: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
 - `nox`: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
 - `rm`: average number of rooms per dwelling.
 - `age`: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
 - `dis`: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
 - `rad`: index of accessibility to radial highways.
 - `tax`: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
 - `ptratio`: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
 - `black`: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where BkBk is the proportion of blacks by town.
 - `lstat`: lower status of the population (percent).
