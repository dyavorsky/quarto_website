# Terminal & Shell

### On Mac

I want to be a person that sits on the command line, but I'm just not.  For the rare times that I do, I use the **[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)** terminal application with the default **zsh** shell on Mac.  

My very minor set of terminal configurations is to apply the 'Catppuccin Mocha' theme by adding `theme = Catppuccin Mocha` to the file `~/.config/ghostty/config`.

In addition, I configure the prompt using [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U8LCjuQzdc) tutorial.

A nice installation guide is provided by [Josean Martinez](https://www.josean.com/posts/terminal-setup). It walks through installation of the **homebrew** package manager, the **iTerm2** terminal application, **Git** version control software, the **Oh My Zsh** framework for managing the Zsh configuration, the **PowerLevel10k** Oh My Zsh theme, and Josean's iTerm2 **coolnight** color scheme.

I have plans to move from **Oh My Zsh** to **Zinit** as my plug-in manager, and to swap my theme from **PowerLevel10k** to **Oh My Posh**, but that day has not yet come. 

My PowerLevel10k theme preferences are the following:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## PowerLevel10k Setup

 - (y) Yes, install the Meslo Nerd Font
 - (2) Classic prompt style
 - (1) Unicode character set
 - (2) Light prompt color
 - (1) 12-hour format for current time
 - (1) Angled prompt separator
 - (1) Sharp prompt heads
 - (1) Flat prompt tails
 - (2) 2-line prompt height
 - (3) Solid prompt connection
 - (1) No prompt frame
 - (2) Sparse prompt spacing
 - (2) Many icons
 - (1) Concise prompt flow
 - (y) Enable transient prompt
 - (1) Verbose instant prompt mode

:::

I also regularly use the **zsh-syntax-highlighting** and **zsh-autosuggestions** plug-ins; the **git** plug-in from Oh My Zsh; and when I'm in a vim mood, the **vi-mode** plug-in. A 3-step procedure downloads, installs, and enables most Zsh plug-ins:

 1. download the plug-in: `git clone <url> $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/<plugin-name>`
 1. add the plug-in name to the array in the `~/.zshrc` file: `plugins=(<plugin-name> <plugin-name> ...)`
 1. reload the Zsh configuration file via `source ~/.zshrc` to enable the plugins

### On Windows

This section needs an update...

I previously use the **Windows Terminal** application, downloaded from the Microsoft Store. I also use [Git-Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or the Windows Subsysten for Linux (WSL) running Ubuntu with Zsh as my shell. For Zsh, I use the **Oh My Zsh** framework with the **PowerLevel10k** theme previously used on my Mac.

# RStudio

Positron is quickly replacing RStudio for me.

#### Visual Look

For the visual look of RStudio, I use the RStudio theme *Darkstudio* and my own version of Atom's *One Dark* editor theme, along with the [Fira Code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fira-code.mirror/) font. They can be installed as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# rstudio theme
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/rileytwo/darkstudio")

path_to_index <- "/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/www/index.htm"
darkstudio::activate(path_to_index) # on mac
darkstudio::activate() # on windows (open rstudio with "run as admin")

# editor theme
url <- "https://github.com/dyavorsky/atom-inspired-rstudio-theme/blob/main/atom_inspired.rstheme"
rstudioapi::addTheme(url, apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

#### Global Options

When installing RStudio on a new machine, ensure the following global options are set:

 - Uncheck *Restore most recently opened project at startup*
 - Uncheck *Restore previously open source documents at startup*
 - Uncheck *Restore .RData into workspace at startup*
 - Set *Save workspace to .RData on exit* to "Never"

#### RStudio Shortcuts

I run a complete set of customized shortcuts in order to:

 - avoid conflicts with system shortcuts and window management shortcuts
 - use a consistent set of key bindings for both Windows and Mac
 - remap bindings for operations I rarely use, to core part of my workflow
 
See [this repo](https://github.com/dyavorsky/configs) for the config files.

# Other Software

 - [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) to track things that need to get done. There's a version for every device and, as a backup, you can always access it from a browser
 - [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) is my password manager.  If you don't have one yet, you won't believe how much simpler and more secure authentication can be
 - [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for tracking academic literature. While not perfect, it's substantially better than a system based on a tree of sub-directories and verbose file names
 - [Typora](https://typora.io/) for writing markdown in a minimal editor (be sure to grab the [onedark](https://theme.typora.io/theme/OneDark/) theme)
