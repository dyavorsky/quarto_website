# Terminal & Shell

### On Mac

I want to be a person that sits on the command line, but I'm just not.  For the rare times that I do, I use the **[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)** terminal application with Mac's default **zsh** shell.

My preferred configurations include:

 - ghostty config: I use the [Catppuccin Mocha](https://catppuccin.com/) theme
 - prompt config: I use [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U8LCjuQzdc) tutorial
 - zsh config: [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions), [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), [eza](https://github.com/z-shell/zsh-eza) (a modern ls replacement), [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (cat replacement), [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (grep replacement) and the ubiquitous fuzzy finder [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), along with vim keybindings and a shortlist of aliases. It's unremarkable, but the config file can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/dyavorsky/configs)
 - Neovim config: As an aspiring vim user, I'm in the process of carefully configuring Neovim as if productivity is just one more plugin away. I'll update this bullet once my config file no longer requires its own readme.

### On Windows

I use Ubuntu via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I use Zsh as the shell, with the **Oh My Zsh** configuration framework and **PowerLevel10k** prompt theme.  I will likely change this setup in the near future.

# RStudio & Positron

I use RStudio and Positron equally.

#### RStudio Visual Look

For the visual look of RStudio, I use the RStudio theme *Darkstudio* and my own version of Atom's *One Dark* editor theme, along with the [Fira Code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fira-code.mirror/) font. They can be installed as follows:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## RStudio Theme Installation

```{r}
#| eval: false

# rstudio theme
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/rileytwo/darkstudio")

path_to_index <- "/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/www/index.htm"
darkstudio::activate(path_to_index) # on mac
darkstudio::activate() # on windows (open rstudio with "run as admin")

# editor theme
url <- "https://github.com/dyavorsky/atom-inspired-rstudio-theme/blob/main/atom_inspired.rstheme"
rstudioapi::addTheme(url, apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

#### RStudio Shortcuts

I run [this](https://github.com/dyavorsky/configs) complete set of customized shortcuts in order to:

 - avoid conflicts with system shortcuts and window management shortcuts
 - use a consistent set of key bindings for both Windows and Mac
 - remap bindings for operations I rarely use, to core part of my workflow


#### Positron Visual Look

I use the 'One Dark Pro Darker' theme, with minimal other customization.  I love how Positron 'just works' out of the box.

# Mac Shortcuts

I aggressively edit keyboard shortcuts on my mac. I find most of the defaults unnecessary, which I disable. I heavily utilize spaces, speech-to-text, and screenshots, adding shortcuts for each. Some apps require their own special additions -- for example, I can't believe Command-Enter doesn't send a message in Mail. I also find the Vimium Chrome extension (which enables keyboard-only navigation within the browser) to be essential.

# Other Software

 - [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) to track things that need to get done. There's a version for every device and, as a backup, you can always access it from a browser
 - [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) is my password manager.  If you don't have one yet, you won't believe how much simpler and more secure authentication can be
 - [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for tracking academic literature. While not perfect, it's substantially better than a system based on a tree of sub-directories and verbose file names
 - [Typora](https://typora.io/) for writing markdown in a minimal editor (be sure to grab the [onedark](https://theme.typora.io/theme/OneDark/) theme)
 - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for maintaining a database of inter-linked markdown-based notes

<!--

## On My Mac

 - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for quick commands and as a sometimes replacement for Mac's spotlight search.
 - [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) as an enhanced screenshot and screen recorder.
 - [HandMirror](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hand-mirror/id1502839586?mt=12) for one-click checks before jumping on video meetings.
 - [Ice](https://icemenubar.app/) to simplify the top-right menu bar.
 - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for tiling windows, which may become obsolete with MacOS 15 Sequoia.
