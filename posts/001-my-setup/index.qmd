# Terminal & Shell

### On Mac

I want to be a person that sits on the command line, but I'm just not.  For the rare times that I do, I use the **[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)** terminal application with the default **zsh** shell on Mac.  

My very minor set of configurations includes:

 - ghostty config: I use the Catppuccin Mocha theme
 - prompt config: I use [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U8LCjuQzdc) tutorial
 - zsh config: I add the zsh-autosuggestions with a double-tab keybinding to accept autosuggestions, the zsh-syntax-highlighting, and vim keybindings with custom functions to change the cursor shape between normal and insert modes. It's unremarkable, but the config file can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/dyavorsky/configs)

### On Windows

I use Ubuntu via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I use Zsh as the shell, with the **Oh My Zsh** configuration framework and **PowerLevel10k** prompt theme.  I will likely change this setup in the near future.

# RStudio & Positron

I use RStudio and Positron equally.

#### RStudio Visual Look

For the visual look of RStudio, I use the RStudio theme *Darkstudio* and my own version of Atom's *One Dark* editor theme, along with the [Fira Code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fira-code.mirror/) font. They can be installed as follows:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## RStudio Theme Installation

```{r}
#| eval: false

# rstudio theme
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/rileytwo/darkstudio")

path_to_index <- "/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/www/index.htm"
darkstudio::activate(path_to_index) # on mac
darkstudio::activate() # on windows (open rstudio with "run as admin")

# editor theme
url <- "https://github.com/dyavorsky/atom-inspired-rstudio-theme/blob/main/atom_inspired.rstheme"
rstudioapi::addTheme(url, apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

#### RStudio Shortcuts

I run [this](https://github.com/dyavorsky/configs) complete set of customized shortcuts in order to:

 - avoid conflicts with system shortcuts and window management shortcuts
 - use a consistent set of key bindings for both Windows and Mac
 - remap bindings for operations I rarely use, to core part of my workflow
 

#### Positron Visual Look

I use the 'One Dark Pro Darker' theme, with minimal other customization.  I love how Positron 'just works' out of the box.

# Mac Shortcuts

I aggressively edit keyboard shortcuts on my mac. I find most of the defaults unnecessary, which I disable. I heavily utilize spaces, speech-to-text, and screenshots, adding shortcuts for each. Some apps require their own special additions -- for example, I can't believe Command-Enter doesn't send a message in Mail. I also find the Vimium Chrome extension (which enables keyboard-only navigation within the browser) to be essential.

# Other Software

 - [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) to track things that need to get done. There's a version for every device and, as a backup, you can always access it from a browser
 - [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) is my password manager.  If you don't have one yet, you won't believe how much simpler and more secure authentication can be
 - [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for tracking academic literature. While not perfect, it's substantially better than a system based on a tree of sub-directories and verbose file names
 - [Typora](https://typora.io/) for writing markdown in a minimal editor (be sure to grab the [onedark](https://theme.typora.io/theme/OneDark/) theme)
 - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for maintaining a database of inter-linked markdown-based notes

<!--

## On My Mac

 - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for quick commands and as a sometimes replacement for Mac's spotlight search. 
 - [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) as an enhanced screenshot and screen recorder.
 - [HandMirror](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hand-mirror/id1502839586?mt=12) for one-click checks before jumping on video meetings.
 - [Ice](https://icemenubar.app/) to simplify the top-right menu bar.
 - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for tiling windows, which may become obsolete with MacOS 15 Sequoia.
