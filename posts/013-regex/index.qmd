###  Core Operators & Grouping Symbols

| Symbol  | Meaning                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `.`     | Any character except newline              |
| `*`     | 0 or more of the previous element         |
| `+`     | 1 or more of the previous element         |
| `?`     | 0 or 1 of the previous element            |
| `{n}`   | Exactly _n_ repetitions                   |
| `{n,}`  | _n_ or more repetitions                   |
| `{n,m}` | Between _n_ and _m_ repetitions           |
| `()`    | Capturing group                           |
| `(?: )` | Non-capturing group                       |
| `[]`    | Character class (match any one inside)    |
| `[^ ]`  | Negated character class                   |
| `\|`    | OR operator                               |
| `^`     | Start of string (or negation inside `[]`) |
| `$`     | End of string                             |

For example `^gr(a|e)y_*beard$` would match graybeard and grey_beard.


### Character Ranges & POSIX Classes

| Pattern         | POSIX Pattern | Meaning            | 
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `[A-Z]`         | `[[:upper:]]` | Uppercase letters  |
| `[a-z]`         | `[[:lower:]]` | Lowercase letters  |
| `[A-Za-z]`      | `[[:alpha:]]` | All letters        |
| `[0-9]`         | `[[:digit:]]` | Digits             |
| `[A-Za-z0-9]`   | `[[:alnum:]]` | Alphanumeric       |
| `[ \t\n\r\f\v]` | `[[:space:]]` | Whitespace (POSIX) |

Whitespace is space, tab, newline, carriage return, form feed, and vertical tab.

For example, if you want 'file_001.txt' through 'file_099.txt' but not eg 'file_123.txt', you could use `^file_0[[:digit:]]{2}.txt$`


### Common Shorthand Character Classes

| Pattern | Meaning                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `\d`    | Digit (same as `[0-9]`)                             |
| `\D`    | Non-digit                                           |
| `\w`    | Word character (letters, digits, underscore)        |
| `\W`    | Non-word character                                  |
| `\s`    | Whitespace                                          |
| `\S`    | Non-whitespace                                      |
| `\b`    | Word boundary                                       |
| `\B`    | Not a word boundary                                 |
| `\A`    | Start of string (stronger than `^` in some engines) |
| `\Z`    | End of string                                       |

For example, one or more words followed by whitespace and 4 digits with nothing else would be `\A\b\w+\b\s\d{4}\Z`
