Vim is a powerful, open-source text editor. It is unique in that you spend most of your time in Normal Mode where key presses execute commands that move and edit text, as opposed to Insert Mode where key presses enter text like a traditional word processor. There is also a Visual Mode and Command Mode, subjects for another post.

#### Movement Commands
