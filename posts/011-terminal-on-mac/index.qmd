## What's what

The **Terminal** is an application on your computer. 

A **Shell** is a program that runs in the Terminal. 

The Shell has a **command-line interface** (CLI) instead of the ubiquitous point-and-click graphical-user interface (GUI) familiar to most computer users. 

To run commands in the Terminal via the Shell (or, equivalently, to execute programs on the command line) you type commands at the **prompt** and hit enter.
