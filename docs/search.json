    "text": "Get the book from Routledge (here) or Amazon (here)\nThis is a truly excellent book explaining the underlying ideas, mathematics, and principles of major statistical concepts. Its organization is suburb, and the authors’ commentary on why a theorem is so useful and how the presented ideas fit together and/or contrast is invaluable (and, quite frankly, better than I have seen anywhere else).\n\n1 Introduction\nSuppose the observed data is the sample \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\{y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\}\\) of size \\(n\\). We will model \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) as a realization of an \\(n\\)-dimensional random vector \\(\\mathbf{Y} = \\{Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\}\\) with a joint distribution \\(f_\\mathbf{Y}(\\mathbf{y})\\). The true distribution of the data is rarely completely known; nevertheless, it can often be reasonable to assume that it belongs to some family of distributions \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). We will assume that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a parametric family, that is, that we know the type of distribution \\(f_\\mathbf{Y}(\\mathbf{y})\\) up to some unknown parameter(s) \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\), where \\(\\Theta\\) is a parameter space. Typically, we will consider the case where \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are the results of independent identical experiments. In this case, \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) can be treated as independent, identically distributed random variables with the common distribution \\(f_\\theta(y)\\) from a parametric family of distributions \\(\\mathcal{F}_\\theta\\), \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\).\nDefine the likelihood function \\(L(\\theta; \\mathbf{y}) = P_\\theta(\\mathbf{y})\\) — the probability to observe the given data \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) for any possible value of \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\). First assume that \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is discrete. The value \\(L(\\theta; \\mathbf{y})\\) can be viewed as a measure of likeliness of \\(\\theta\\) to the observed data \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). If \\(L(\\theta_1; \\mathbf{y}) &gt; L(\\theta_2; \\mathbf{y})\\) for a given \\(\\mathbf{y}\\), we can say that the value \\(\\theta_1\\) for \\(\\theta\\) is more suited to the data than \\(\\theta_2\\). For a continuous random variable \\(\\mathbf{y}\\), the likelihood ratio \\(L(\\theta_1; \\mathbf{y})/L(\\theta_2; \\mathbf{y})\\) shows the strength of the evidence in favor of \\(\\theta = \\theta_1\\) vs \\(\\theta = \\theta_2\\).\nA statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is any real or vector-valued function that can be computed using the data alone. A statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is sufficient for an unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\) if the conditional distribution of all the data \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) given \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) does not depend on the \\(\\theta\\). In other words, given \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) no other information on \\(\\theta\\) can be extracted from \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). This definition allows one to check whether a given statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is sufficient for \\(\\theta\\), but it does not provide one with a constructive way to find it.\nHowever, the Fisher-Neyman Factorization Theorem says that a statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is sufficient for \\(\\theta\\) iff for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\) that \\(L(\\theta, \\mathbf{y}) = g(T(\\mathbf{y}), \\theta) \\cdot h(\\mathbf{y})\\), where the function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) depends on \\(\\theta\\) and the statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\), while \\(h(\\mathbf{y})\\) does not depend on \\(\\theta\\). In particular, if the likelihood \\(L(\\theta; \\mathbf{y})\\) depends on data only through \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\), then \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is a sufficient statistic for \\(\\theta\\) and \\(h(\\mathbf{y}) = 1\\).\nA sufficient statistic is not unique. For example, the entire sample \\(\\mathbf{Y} = \\{Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\}\\) is always a (trivial) sufficient statistic. We may seek a minimal sufficient statistic implying the maximal reduction of the data. A statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is called a minimal sufficient statistic if it is a function of any other sufficient statistic.\nAnother important property of a statistic is completeness. Let \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n \\sim f_\\theta(y)\\), where \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\). A statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is complete if no statistic \\(g(\\mathbf{T})\\) exists (except \\(g(\\mathbf{T})=0\\)) such that \\(E_\\theta g(\\mathbf{T}) = 0\\) for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\). In other words, if \\(E_\\theta g(\\mathbf{T}) = 0\\) for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\), then necessarily \\(g(\\mathbf{T})=0\\). To verify completeness for a general distribution can be a nontrivial mathematical problem, but thankfully it is much simpler for the exponential family of distributions that includes many of the “common” distributions. Completeness is a useful in determining minimal sufficiency because if a sufficient statistic \\(T(\\mathbf{Y})\\) is complete, then it is also minimal sufficient. (Note, however, that a minimal sufficient statistic may not necessarily be complete.)\nA (generally multivariate) family of distributions \\({f_\\theta(\\mathbf{y}): \\theta \\in \\Theta}\\) is said to be an (one parameter) exponential family if: (1) \\(\\Theta\\) is an open interval, (2) the support of the distribution \\(f_\\theta\\) does not depend on \\(\\theta\\), and (3) \\(f_\\theta(\\mathbf{y}) = exp\\{c(\\theta)T(\\mathbf{y}) + d(\\theta) + S(\\mathbf{y})\\}\\) where \\(c(\\cdot)\\), \\(T(\\cdot)\\), \\(d(\\cdot)\\), and \\(S(\\cdot)\\) are known functions; \\(c(\\theta)\\) is usually called the natural parameter of the distribution. We say that \\(f_\\theta\\) where \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots \\theta_p)\\) belongs to a \\(k\\)-parameter exponential family by changing (3) such that \\(f_\\theta(\\mathbf{y}) = exp\\{ \\sum_{j=1}^k c_j(\\theta)T_j(\\mathbf{y}) + d(\\theta) + S(\\mathbf{y})\\}\\). The function \\(c(\\theta) = \\{c_1(\\theta), \\ldots, c_k(\\theta)\\}\\) are the natural parameters of the distribution. (Note that the dimensionality \\(p\\) of the original parameter \\(\\theta\\) is not necessarily the same as the dimensionality \\(k\\) of the natural parameter \\(c(\\theta)\\).)\nConsider a random sample \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\), where \\(Y_i \\sim f_\\theta(y)\\) and \\(f_\\theta\\) belongs to a \\(k\\)-parameter exponential family of distributions, then (1) the joint distribution of \\(\\mathbf{Y} = (Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) also belongs to the \\(k\\)-parameter exponential family, (2) \\(T_\\mathbf{Y} = (\\sum_{i=1}^n T_1(Y_i), \\ldots, \\sum_{i=1}^n T_k(Y_i))\\) is the sufficient statistic for \\(c(\\theta) = (c_1(\\theta), \\ldots, c_k(\\theta))\\) (and, therefore, for \\(\\theta\\)), and (3) if some regularity conditions hold, then \\(T_\\mathbf{Y}\\) is complete and therefore minimal sufficient (if the latter exists).\n\n\n2 Point Estimation\nEstimation of the unknown parameters of distributions from the data is one of the key issues in statistics. A (point) estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{\\theta}(\\mathbf{Y})\\) of an unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\) is any statistic used for estimating \\(\\theta\\). The value of \\(\\hat{\\theta}(\\mathbf{y})\\) evaluated for a given sample is called an estimate. This is a general, somewhat trivial definition that does not say anything about the goodness of estimation; one would evidently be interested in “good” estimators.\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation is the most used method of estimation of parameters in parametric models. As we’ve discussed, \\(L(\\theta; \\mathbf{y})\\) is the measure of likeliness of a parameter’s values \\(\\theta\\) for the observed data \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). It is only natural then to seek the “most likely” value of \\(\\theta\\). The MLE \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta\\in\\Theta} L(\\theta; \\mathbf{y})\\) — the value of \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the likelihood. Often we are interested in a function of a parameter \\(\\xi = g(\\theta)\\). When \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is 1:1, the MLE of \\(\\xi\\) is the function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) applied to the MLE of \\(\\theta\\): \\(\\hat{\\xi} = g(\\hat{\\theta})\\), the proof of which is just a reparameterization of the likelihood in terms of \\(\\xi\\) instead of \\(\\theta\\). Although the conception of the MLE was motivated by an intuitively clear underlying idea, the justification for its use is much deeper. It is a really “good” method of estimation (to be discussed later on the topic of asymptotics).\nAnother popular method of estimation is the Method of Moments. Its main idea is based on expressing the population moments of the distribution of data in terms of its unknown parameter(s) and equating them to their corresponding sample moments. MMEs have some known problems: consider a sample of size 4 from a uniform distribution \\(U(0, \\theta)\\) with the observed sample 0.2, 0.6, 2, and 0.4. The MME is 1.6, which does not make much sense given the observed value of 2 in the sample. For these and related reasons, the MMEs are less used than the MLE counterparts. However, MMEs are usually simpler to compute and can be used, for example, as reasonable initial values in numerical iterative procedures for MLEs. On the other hand, the Method of Moments does not require knowledge of the entire distribution of the data (up to the unknown parameters) but only its moments and thus may be less sensitive to possible misspecification of a model.\nThe Method of Least Squares play a key role in regression and analysis of variance. In a typical regression setup, we are given \\(n\\) observations \\((\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\), \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\) over \\(m\\) explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\ldots, x_m)\\) and the response variable \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\). We assume that \\(y_i = g_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_i) + \\varepsilon_i\\), \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\) where the response function \\(g_\\theta(\\cdot): \\mathbb{R}^m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) has a known parametric form and depends on \\(p \\le n\\) unknown parameters \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_p)\\). The LSE looks for a \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) that yields the best fit \\(g_\\hat{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})\\) to the observed \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) w.r.t. the Euclidean distance: \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\arg\\min_\\theta \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - g_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_i))^2\\). For linear regression, the solution is available in closed form. For non-linear regression, however, it can generally be only found numerically.\nMore generally than the three above procedures, one can consider any function \\(\\rho(\\theta, y)\\) as a measure of the goodness-of-fit and look for an estimator that maximizes or minimizes \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\rho(\\theta, y_i)\\) w.r.t. \\(\\theta\\). Such estimators are called M-estimators. It runs out that various well-known estimators can be viewed as M-estimators for a particular \\(\\rho(\\theta, y)\\) including \\(\\bar{Y}\\) for the sample mean as well as MLE, LSE, and a generalized version of MME not yet discussed. As we’ll see when discussing asymptotics, M-estimators share many important asymptotic properties.\nA natural question is how to compare between various estimators. First, we should define a measure of goodness-of-estimation. Recall that any estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{\\theta}(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) is a function of a random sample and therefore is a random variable itself with a certain distribution, expectation, variance, etc. A somewhat naive attempt to measure the goodness-of-estimation of \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) would be to consider the error \\(|\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta|\\). However, \\(\\theta\\) is unknown and, as we have mentioned, an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is a random variable and hence the value \\(|\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta|\\) will vary from sample to sample. It may be “small” for some of the samples, while “large” for others and therefore cannot be used as a proper criterion for goodness-of-estimation of an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). A more reasonable measure would then be an average distance over all possible samples, that is, the mean absolute error \\(E|\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta|\\), where the expectation is taken w.r.t. the joint distribution of \\(\\mathbf{Y} = (Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\). It indeed can be used as a measure of goodness-of-estimation but usually, mostly due to convenience of differentiation, the conventional measure is the mean squared error (MSE) given by \\(MSE(\\hat{\\theta}, \\theta) = E(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta)^2\\).\nThe MSE can be decomposed into two components: \\(MSE(\\hat{\\theta}, \\theta) = Var(\\hat{\\theta}) + b^2(\\hat{\\theta},\\theta)\\). The first is the stochastic error (variance) and the second is a systematic or deterministic error (bias). Having defined the goodness-of-estimation measure by MSE, one can compare different estimators and choose the one with the smallest MSE. However, since the \\(MSE(\\hat{\\theta}, \\theta)\\) typically depends on the unknown \\(\\theta\\), it is a common situation where no estimator is uniformly superior for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\).\nIdeally, a good estimator with a small MSE should have both low variance and low bias. However, it might be hard to have both. One of the common approaches is to first control the bias component of the overall MSE and to consider unbiased estimators. There is no general rule or algorithm for deriving an unbiased estimator. In fact, unbiasedness is a property of an estimator rather than a method of estimation. One usually checks an MLE or any other estimator for bias. Sometimes one can then modify the original estimator to “correct” its bias. Note that unlike ML estimation, unbiasedness is not invariant under nonlinear transformation of the original parameter: if \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\theta\\), \\(g(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is generally a biased estimator for \\(g(\\theta)\\).\nWhat does unbiasedness of an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) actually mean? Suppose we were observing not a single sample but all possible samples of size \\(n\\) from a sample space and were calculating the estimates \\(\\hat{\\theta}_j\\) for each one of them. The unbiasedness means that the average value of \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) over the entire sample space is \\(\\theta\\), but it does not guarantee yet that \\(\\hat{\\theta}_j \\approx \\theta\\) for each particular sample. The dispersion of \\(\\hat{\\theta}_j\\)’s around their average value \\(\\theta\\) might be large and, since in reality we have only a single sample, its particular value of \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) might be quite away from \\(\\theta\\). To ensure with high confidence that \\(\\hat{\\theta}_j \\approx \\theta\\) for any sample we need in addition for the variance \\(Var(\\hat{\\theta})\\) to be small.\nAn estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is called a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of \\(\\theta\\) if \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is unbiased and for any other unbiased estimator \\(\\tilde{\\theta}\\) of \\(\\theta\\), \\(Var(\\hat{\\theta}) \\le Var(\\tilde{\\theta})\\). If the UMVUE exists, it is necessarily unique. Recall that there is no general algorithm to obtain unbiased estimators in general and a UMVUE in particular. However, there exists a lower bound for a variance of an unbiased estimator, which can be used as a benchmark for evaluating its goodness.\nDefine the Fisher Information Number \\(I(\\theta) = E((\\ln f_\\theta(\\mathbf{y}))'_\\theta)^2\\). The derivative of the log density is sometimes called the Score Function. Thus, the Fisher Information Number is the expected square of the Score. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound Theorem states that if \\(T\\) is an unbiased estimator for \\(g(\\theta)\\), where \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is differentiable, then \\(Var(T) \\ge (g'(\\theta))^2 / I(\\theta)\\) or more simply, when \\(T\\) is an unbiased estimator for \\(\\theta\\), \\(Var(T) \\ge 1 / I(\\theta)\\). We are especially interested in the case where \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) is a random sample from a distribution \\(f_\\theta(y)\\). In that case, \\(I(\\theta) = nI^*(\\theta)\\) where \\(I^*(\\theta) = E((\\ln f_\\theta(y))'_\\theta)^2\\) is the Fisher Information Number of \\(f_\\theta(y)\\), and, therefore, for any unbiased estimator \\(T\\) of \\(g(\\theta)\\), we have that \\(Var(T) \\ge (g'_\\theta(\\theta))^2 / nI^*(\\theta)\\). There is another, usually more convenient formula for calculating the Fisher Information Number \\(I(\\theta)\\) other than its direct definition: \\(I(\\theta) = -E(\\ln f_\\theta(\\mathbf{Y}))''_\\theta\\).\nIt is important to emphasize that the CRLB theorem is one direction only: if the variance of an unbiased estimator does not achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound, one still cannot claim that it is not an UMVUE. Nevertheless, it can be used as a benchmark for measuring the goodness of an unbiased estimator. One special result related to the exponential family distribution: the Cramer-Rao lower bound is achieved only for distributions from the exponential family.\nThe Cramer-Rao lower bound allows one only to evaluate the goodness of a proposed unbiased estimator but does not provide any constructive way to derive it. In fact, as we have argued, there is no such general rule at all. However, if one manages to obtain any initial (even crude) unbiased estimator, it may be possible to improve it. The Rao-Blackwell Theorem shows that if there is an unbiased estimator that is not a function of a sufficient statistic \\(W\\), one can construct another unbiased estimator based on \\(W\\) with an MSE not larger than the original one: let \\(T\\) be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(W\\) be a sufficient statistic for \\(\\theta\\), and define \\(T_1 = E(T|W)\\), then \\(T_1\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(Var(T_1) \\le Var(T)\\). Thus, in terms of MSE, only unbiased estimators based on a sufficient statistic are of interest. This demonstrates again a strong sense of the notion of sufficiency.\nDoes Rao-Blackwellization necessarily yield an UMVUE? Generally not. To guarantee UMVUE an additional requirement of completeness on a sufficient statistic \\(W\\) is needed. The Lehmann-Scheffe Theorem formalizes this: if \\(T\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(W\\) is a complete sufficient statistic for \\(\\theta\\), then \\(T_1 = E(T|W)\\) is the unique UMVUE of \\(\\theta\\). Even without the Lehmann-Scheffe theorem, it can be shown under mild conditions that if the distribution of the data belongs to the exponential family and an unbiased estimator is a function of the corresponding sufficient statistic, it is an UMVUE. Note that despite its elegance, the application of the Rao-Blackwell Theorem in more complicated cases is quite limited. The two main obstacles are in finding an initial unbiased estimator \\(T\\) and calculating the conditional expectation \\(E(T|W)\\)\n\n\n3 Confidence Intervals, Bounds, and Regions\nWhen we estimate a parameter we essentially “guess” its value. This should be a “well educated guess,” hopefully the best of its kind (in whatever sense). However, statistical estimation is made with error. Presenting just the estimator, no matter how good it is, is usually not enough – one should give an idea about the estimation error. The words “estimation” and “estimate” (in contrast to “measure” and “value”) point to the fact that an estimate is an inexact appraisal of a value. Great efforts of statistics are invested in trying to quantify the estimation error and find ways to express it in a well-defined way.\nAny estimator has error, that is, if \\(\\theta\\) is estimated by \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), then \\(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta\\) is usually different from \\(0\\). The standard measure of error is the mean squared error \\(MSE = E(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta)^2\\). When together with the value of the estimator we are given its MSE, we get a feeling of how precise the estimate is. It is more common to quote the standard error defined by \\(SE(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{MSE(\\hat{\\theta}, \\theta)} = \\sqrt{E(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta)^2}\\). Unlike the MSE, the SE is measured in the same units as the estimator.\nHowever, the MSE expresses an average squared estimation error but tells nothing about its distribution, which generally might be complicated. One would be interested, in particular, in the probability \\(P(|\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta| &gt; c)\\) that the estimation error exceeds a certain accuracy level \\(c &gt; 0\\). Markov’s Inequality enables us to translate the MSE into an upper bound on this probability: \\(P(|\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta| \\ge c) \\le MSE/c^2\\). However, this bound is usually very conservative and the actual probability may be much smaller. Typically, a quite close approximation of the error distribution is obtained by the Central Limit Theorem (discussed later).\nAbove, we suggested quoting the SE besides the estimator itself. However, standard statistical practice is different and it is not very intuitive. There are a few conceptual difficulties in being precise when talking about the error. Suppose we estimate \\(\\mu\\) with \\(\\bar{Y}\\) and we find \\(\\bar{Y}=10\\) and \\(SE=0.2\\). We are quite confident that \\(\\mu\\) is between \\(9.6\\) and \\(10.4\\). However, this statement makes no probabilistic sense. The true \\(\\mu\\) is either in the interval \\((9.6,10.4)\\) or it’s not. The unknown \\(\\mu\\) is not a random variable – it has a single fixed value, whether or not it is known to the statistician.\nThe “trick” that has been devised is to move from a probabilistic statement about the unknown (but with a fixed value) parameter to a probabilistic statement about the method. We say something like: “The interval \\((9.6,10.4)\\) for the value \\(\\mu\\) was constructed by a method with is 95% successful.” Since the method is usually successful, we have confidence in its output.\nLet \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n \\sim f_\\theta(y)\\), \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\). A \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) Confidence Interval for \\(\\theta\\) is the pair of scalar-valued statistics \\(L=L(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) and \\(U=U(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) such that \\(P(L \\le \\theta \\le U) \\ge 1-\\alpha\\) for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\) with the inequality as closs to an equality as possible.\nWhat is the right value of \\(\\alpha\\)? Nothing in the statistical theory dictates a particular choice. But the standard values are \\(0.10\\), \\(0.05\\), and \\(0.01\\) with \\(0.05\\) being most common.\nA pivot is a function \\(\\psi(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n; \\theta)\\) of the data and the parameters, whose distribution does not depend on unknown parameters. Note, the pivot is not a statistic and cnanot be calculated form the data, exactly because it depends on the unknown parameters. On the other hand, since its distribution does not depend on the unknown parameters, we can find an interval \\(A_\\alpha\\) such that \\(P(\\psi(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n; \\theta) \\in A_\\alpha) = 1 - \\alpha\\). Then we can invert the inclusion and define the interval (or region in general) \\(C_\\alpha = \\{\\theta : \\psi(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n; \\theta) \\in A_\\alpha \\}\\). The set \\(C_\\alpha\\) is then a \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence set. Note that \\(C_\\alpha\\) is a random set because it depends on the random sample.\nDoes a pivot always exist? For a random sample \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) from any continuous distribution with a cdf \\(F_\\theta(y)\\), the value \\(-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln F_\\theta(Y_i) \\sim \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{2n}\\) and, therefore, is a pivot. However, in the general case, it might be difficult (if possible) to invert the corresponding confidence interval for this pivot to a confidence interval for the original parameter of interest \\(\\theta\\). More convenient pivots are easy to find when the distribution belongs to a scale-location family.\nIs a confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\) necessarily unique? Definitely not! Different choices of pivots lead to different forms of confidence intervals. Moreover, even for a given pivot, one can typically construct an infinite set of confidence intervals at the same confidence level. What is the “best” choice for a confidence interval? A conventional, somewhat ad hoc approach is based on error symmetry: set \\(P(L&gt;\\theta) = P(U&lt;\\theta) = \\alpha/2\\). A more appealing approach would be to seek a confidence interval of a minimal expected length; however, in general, this leads to a nonlinear minimization problem that might not have a solution in closed form.\nA parameter of interest may be not the original parameter \\(\\theta\\) but its function \\(g(\\theta)\\). Let \\((L,U)\\) be a \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\) and \\(g(\\cdot)\\) a strictly increasing function. Then \\((g(L),g(U))\\) is a \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(g(\\theta)\\).\nThe normal confidence intervals are undoubtedly the most important. We do not claim that most data sets are sampled from a normal distribution – this is definitely far from being true. However, what really matters is whether the distribution of an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{\\theta}(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) is close to normal rather than the distribution of \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) themselves. When discussing asymptotics later, we argue that many estimators based on large or even medium sized samples are indeed approximately normal and, therefore, the normal confidence intervals can (at least approximately) be used.\n\n\n4 Hypothesis Testing\nTo be added\n\n\n5 Asymptotic Analysis\nTo be added\n\n\n6 Bayesian Inference\nTo be added\n\n\n7 Elements of Statistical Decision Theory\nTo be added\n\n\n8 Linear Models\nTo be added\n\n\n9 Nonparametric Estimation\nTo be added"

    "text": "This short article seeks to describe the Gumbel (or Type-1 Generalized Extreme Value) distribution and how it’s use in probabilistic discrete choice models leads to a closed-form expression for choice probabilities.\nA standard framework for a probabilistic discrete choice model (DCM) reflecting a random utility theory (RUT) is as follows:\n\nThe utility that decision maker \\(i\\) obtains from alternative \\(j\\) is \\(U_{ij}\\), for \\(j = 1, \\ldots, J\\).\nThe decision maker chooses the alternative that provides the greatest utility: choose alternative \\(k\\) if and only if \\(U_{ik} &gt; U_{ij} \\hspace{1ex} \\forall j \\ne k\\).\nUtility is decomposed to reflect the researcher’s inability to understand or observe all factors that impact choices: \\(U_{ij} = V_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) where the joint density of the random vector \\(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i = (\\varepsilon_{i1}, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{iJ})\\) for decision maker \\(i\\) is \\(f_{\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i}(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i)\\).\n\nThe probability that decision maker \\(i\\) chooses alternative \\(k\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    P_{ik}\n    &= \\text{Prob}\\left( U_{ik} &gt; U_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right)  &\\\\\n    &= \\text{Prob}\\left( V_{ik} + \\varepsilon_{ik} &gt; V_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right)  &\\\\\n    &= \\text{Prob}\\left( \\varepsilon_{ij} &lt; \\varepsilon_{ik} + V_{ik} - V_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right)  &\\\\\n    &= \\int_{\\varepsilon_i} I\\left( \\varepsilon_{ij} &lt; \\varepsilon_{ik} + V_{ik} - V_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right) \\, f_{\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i}(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i) \\, d \\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i &\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(I(\\cdot)\\) is the indicator function equaling one when the expression in parentheses is true and zero otherwise.\nA standard assumption about the joint distribution of vector \\(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i\\) is that the components are independent and identically distributed as Gumbel random variables. Specifically, the cumulative distribution function for each \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is: \\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\varepsilon_{ij} \\leq x) = \\exp(-\\exp(-x)) = e^{-e^{-x}}\n\\] The Gumbel density and distribution are plotted below (in black) alongside the Normal (in dashed red) for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause each \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is assumed to be independently distributed, the probability of decision maker \\(i\\) choosing alternative \\(k\\) for a given value of \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) can be written as the product of the \\(J-1\\) conditional distributions:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    P_{ik} | \\varepsilon_{ik}\n    &= \\prod_{j \\ne k} \\exp(-\\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik})) &\\\\\n    &= \\exp \\left( -\\sum_{j \\ne k} \\exp \\left( - ( \\varepsilon_{ik} + V_{ik} - V_{ij}) \\right) \\right) &\\\\\n    &= \\exp \\left( - \\exp(\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\sum_{j \\ne k} \\exp \\left( V_{ij} - V_{ik}) \\right) \\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBut of course \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) is not given, so to obtain the desired probability \\(P_{ik}\\), we must integrate over all possible values of \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\), weighted by its marginal density \\(f_{\\varepsilon_{ik}}(\\varepsilon_{ik}) = \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\exp ( -\\exp(\\varepsilon_{ik})\\): \\[\nP_{ik} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\exp \\left( - \\exp(\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\sum_{j=1}^J \\exp \\left( V_{ij} - V_{ik}) \\right) \\right) \\, d \\varepsilon_{ik}\n\\]\nFor notational simplicity, denote \\(a = \\sum_{j=1}^J \\exp ( V_{ij} - V_{ik})\\) and define the transformation of variables \\(z = \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik})\\). Then \\(dz = -\\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\, d \\varepsilon_{ik} = -z \\, d \\varepsilon_{ik}\\) and the integral becomes: \\[\nP_{ik} = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} z \\times \\exp ( - z \\times a ) / (-z) \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp (-z \\times a ) \\, dz\n\\]\nEvaluating the integral yields: \\[\nP_{ik} = - \\left[ \\frac{1}{a} \\times \\left( 0 - 1 \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=1}^J \\exp ( V_{ij} - V_{ik})} = \\frac{\\exp ( V_{ik} )}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{J} \\exp ( V_{ij} )}\n\\]\nThis is the standard multinomial logit (MNL) choice probability."

    "text": "Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It enables you to write plain text (.qmd) source files and render them into consumable (e.g., html, pdf) output files. This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a website with Quarto. This information is also available on the excellent Quarto website and in several other tutorials. A subsequent post (this one) demonstrates how to freely host your website on GitHub.\nOne main purpose for creating a website with Quarto is the ability to add “blog” posts written as Quarto documents. These documents can contain code (e.g., R, Python, C++, Julia, other) which – as part of the rendering process – will run the code and embed the code’s output (e.g., numeric results or plots) in the rendered html output file. As a result, a publication-ready blog post can be written as one Quarto source file and no copy/paste is necessary to include code or the code’s resulting numeric or graphic output.\nSo, let’s go make that website."

You can check your version of RStudio by going to RStudio’s Help menu and selecting “About RStudio.”\nIf you prefer VS Code, the command line, or another IDE, you can download and install Quarto from quarto.org. VS Code users should also install the Quarto VS Code Extension.\nYou can confirm that Quarto is installed by running quarto --version at the command line in the Terminal (on Mac or Linux) or in the Git-Bash terminal on Windows – note that this is not the R console. If a version number is returned, you’re good to go.\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ quarto --version"

There are 5 built-in templates; a preview of each is available in the Quarto documentation.\nWe’ve also added buttons that link to our email and LinkedIn profile. You can add addition buttons decorated with any of the Bootstrap 5 icons.\nFinally, outside of the YAML document header, we started to add some text. Here, you can expand the content with additional information, images, or any of Quarto’s document authoring options.\n\nAt this point, re-render your website to check out your customized “about you” landing page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot"

But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you.\nA lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.\n\n\n\nTeddy Roosevelt: The Man in the Arena (link)\n\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.\nThe credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

    "text": "Step 1: Get Git and GCM\nGit is a free, open source, and distributed version control system. Practically, what this means is that you can use Git to track a history of your work on a project, to “back up” your project on a cloud-based Git repository service like GitHub, and/or to collaborate simultaneously but asynchronously with others on a project. It is the the most popular VCS; anyone who writes any amount of code should be familiar with the basics of Git.\nFirst, check to see if you have Git already installed. On Windows, this amounts to checking to see if you have an application called Git-Bash accessible from the Start Menu. On Mac or Linux, run git --version in the Terminal. If a version number is returned, you have Git.\nWhether or not you have Git, follow the remaining instructions to install the Git Credential Manager (GCM), which substantially improves the process of authenticating your computer with GitHub when you push local files to your remote respository.\nOn Windows, go to git.scm.com and download “Git for Windows” which is a bundle of software that includes Git, the Git-Bash Terminal, and the Git Credential Manager.\nOn Mac, I recommend using Homebrew, which is a package manager (very loosely, it’s like an App Store for your Terminal). Unlike the Windows instructions just above, this is a multi-step process.\n\nCheck to see if you have Homebrew installed by running brew --version in the Terminal. If a version number is returned, you do. If not, visit https://brew.sh, copy the line of code at the top of their webpage, and paste/run that line of code in your Terminal. It should look something like:\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nFollow along at the Terminal, as you may need to enter your computer log-in password and/or indicate you agree to various terms or licenses. Note that when you type your password at the command line in the terminal, the cursor will not move. This is for security and privacy reasons. But rest assured that your input is being received. So type out your password when/where necessary and hit enter.\n\nNext, install Git by running brew install git at the Terminal. If you receive an error like “zsh: command not found: brew” run the following line of code in the Terminal and then try again to install Git. (What’s going on here is that Homebrew makes its location known to the Bash shell but not to Zsh, which is the newer and now-default shell on MacOS, so the following line of code tells Zsh where to look for Homebrew.)\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ export PATH=\"/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\" &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc\n\n\nWith Git successfully installed, next install the Git Credential Manager by running the following at the terminal. As before, follow along at the Terminal, as you may need to enter your computer log-in password and/or indicate you agree to various terms or licenses.\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ brew install git-credential-manager"

You create this history by taking snapshots of the state of your project at various times. These snapshots are called “commits”. Taking a snapshot is a two-step process: you first stage the files you want in your snapshot with git add and then you take the snapshot with git commit. All commits include a message.\nYou can take snapshots with helpful tools built into RStudio or VS Code, or you can use the command line in the Terminal.\nIn the Terminal, run the follow to stage all new or modified files and commit them:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"type a commit message in here\"\n\nIn RStudio, use the Git tab. Check the box to the left of each file to stage it, then click the little “Commit” button at the top of the tab. This pops up a window where you can enter your commit message. Then click the big “Commit” button to finalize your snapshot. Close the pop-up window.\nIn VS Code, use the third-from-top button in the Activity Bar at the far-left of the application to access the Source Control panel. There you’ll find helpful buttons like the plus-sign button to stage all files, a text box to enter your commit message, and the big blue “Commit” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudioVS Code\n\n\nadd image\n\n\nadd image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, everything is all set locally on your machine.

I render every few minutes. I might make a commit once an hour or so. I may push my work just once at the end of those 3 hours.\nRemember that the workflow provided in this tutorial requires you to render locally and then push everything in its final form to GitHub. I often make a local edit, forget to render, but commit that edit and push it to GitHub. Then I look at my website and wonder why the edit isn’t there. It’s because I edited the .qmd file, but since I didn’t render, the html file was never updated. Be sure to render locally before you commit and push!"
