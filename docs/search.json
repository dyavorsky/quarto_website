    "section": "",
    "text": "This short article seeks to describe the Gumbel (or Type-1 Generalized Extreme Value) distribution and how it’s use in probabilistic discrete choice models leads to a closed-form expression for choice probabilities.\nA standard framework for a probabilistic discrete choice model (DCM) reflecting a random utility theory (RUT) is as follows:\n\nThe utility that decision maker \\(i\\) obtains from alternative \\(j\\) is \\(U_{ij}\\), for \\(j = 1, \\ldots, J\\).\nThe decision maker chooses the alternative that provides the greatest utility: choose alternative \\(k\\) if and only if \\(U_{ik} &gt; U_{ij} \\hspace{1ex} \\forall j \\ne k\\).\nUtility is decomposed to reflect the researcher’s inability to understand or observe all factors that impact choices: \\(U_{ij} = V_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) where the joint density of the random vector \\(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i = (\\varepsilon_{i1}, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{iJ})\\) for decision maker \\(i\\) is \\(f_{\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i}(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i)\\).\n\nThe probability that decision maker \\(i\\) chooses alternative \\(k\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    P_{ik}\n    &= \\text{Prob}\\left( U_{ik} &gt; U_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right)  &\\\\\n    &= \\text{Prob}\\left( V_{ik} + \\varepsilon_{ik} &gt; V_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right)  &\\\\\n    &= \\text{Prob}\\left( \\varepsilon_{ij} &lt; \\varepsilon_{ik} + V_{ik} - V_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right)  &\\\\\n    &= \\int_{\\varepsilon_i} I\\left( \\varepsilon_{ij} &lt; \\varepsilon_{ik} + V_{ik} - V_{ij} \\; \\forall j \\ne k \\right) \\, f_{\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i}(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i) \\, d \\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i &\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(I(\\cdot)\\) is the indicator function equaling one when the expression in parentheses is true and zero otherwise.\nA standard assumption about the joint distribution of vector \\(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_i\\) is that the components are independent and identically distributed as Gumbel random variables. Specifically, the cumulative distribution function for each \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is: \\[\n\\text{Prob}(\\varepsilon_{ij} \\leq x) = \\exp(-\\exp(-x)) = e^{-e^{-x}}\n\\] The Gumbel density and distribution are plotted below (in black) alongside the Normal (in dashed red) for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause each \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is assumed to be independently distributed, the probability of decision maker \\(i\\) choosing alternative \\(k\\) for a given value of \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) can be written as the product of the \\(J-1\\) conditional distributions:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    P_{ik} | \\varepsilon_{ik}\n    &= \\prod_{j \\ne k} \\exp(-\\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik})) &\\\\\n    &= \\exp \\left( -\\sum_{j \\ne k} \\exp \\left( - ( \\varepsilon_{ik} + V_{ik} - V_{ij}) \\right) \\right) &\\\\\n    &= \\exp \\left( - \\exp(\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\sum_{j \\ne k} \\exp \\left( V_{ij} - V_{ik}) \\right) \\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBut of course \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) is not given, so to obtain the desired probability \\(P_{ik}\\), we must integrate over all possible values of \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\), weighted by its marginal density \\(f_{\\varepsilon_{ik}}(\\varepsilon_{ik}) = \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\exp ( -\\exp(\\varepsilon_{ik})\\): \\[\nP_{ik} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\exp \\left( - \\exp(\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\times \\sum_{j=1}^J \\exp \\left( V_{ij} - V_{ik}) \\right) \\right) \\, d \\varepsilon_{ik}\n\\]\nFor notational simplicity, denote \\(a = \\sum_{j=1}^J \\exp ( V_{ij} - V_{ik})\\) and define the transformation of variables \\(z = \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik})\\). Then \\(dz = -\\exp(-\\varepsilon_{ik}) \\, d \\varepsilon_{ik} = -z \\, d \\varepsilon_{ik}\\) and the integral becomes: \\[\nP_{ik} = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} z \\times \\exp ( - z \\times a ) / (-z) \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp (-z \\times a ) \\, dz\n\\]\nEvaluating the integral yields: \\[\nP_{ik} = - \\left[ \\frac{1}{a} \\times \\left( 0 - 1 \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=1}^J \\exp ( V_{ij} - V_{ik})} = \\frac{\\exp ( V_{ik} )}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{J} \\exp ( V_{ij} )}\n\\]\nThis is the standard multinomial logit (MNL) choice probability."
